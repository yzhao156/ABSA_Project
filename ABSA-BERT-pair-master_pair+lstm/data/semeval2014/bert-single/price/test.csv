32936760#1397861#8	none	price	Good cake BUT: it was not the best cake i've ever had, and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees.
35720486#684689#1	none	price	The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone, but they were out of it that day.
35719198#0#3	none	price	The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour.
33507331#1177339#1	none	price	It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere.

11351354#412616#1	none	price	The service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game.
11349840#433070#8	none	price	If you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal.

11660930#655010#4	none	price	Stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great.
35509422#0#0	none	price	Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint.
35509422#0#1	none	price	Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night.

11359613#884374#0	none	price	The food is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me.
11349840#433070#6	none	price	The pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies.
32894267#698671#4	none	price	don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic.
35693083#822138#1	none	price	Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (I hope Mom doesn't read this!).

11351587#1488758#1	none	price	The ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic.
33069925#747092#3	positive	price	but, the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection).

11359764#1373169#1	none	price	Who said go when the place is quiet during the day?
35698351#821341#1	none	price	Can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size.
11351360#1704700#0	none	price	I was on jury duty, rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and Hibiscus lemonade.
32894791#1611374#1	none	price	good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine.
36072604#1106889#4	none	price	Very nice touch that very much fits the place.
11350033#1264371#2	none	price	However, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile.
11567247#1415594#1	none	price	We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor.
11351521#768768#2	none	price	If you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location.
11350033#1264371#5	none	price	A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there.
11651065#413029#1	none	price	The comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good.
11349445#757796#4	none	price	It's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book.
11351816#1162694#2	none	price	Slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices?
32897564#894393#1	none	price	The sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella.
11349845#1188496#2	none	price	Don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining.
33070305#1312437#5	none	price	The room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go.
11432842#416795#4	positive	price	Prices even outside of restaurant week were great.

11464511#471981#2	none	price	I don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable.
11351587#1488758#3	none	price	It is bland and nothing extrodinary.
32950061#1264345#3	none	price	I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party.
