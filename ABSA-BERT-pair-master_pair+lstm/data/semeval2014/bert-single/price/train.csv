3121	none	price	But the staff was so horrible to us.
2777	none	price	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.

1571	negative	price	It is very overpriced and not very tasty.
1458	none	price	Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).
3161	none	price	The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.
2391	none	price	Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.
986	none	price	i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played.

2061	none	price	but overall i give it a 10
2274	positive	price	Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.

2845	none	price	This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.
187	none	price	This restaurant used to be pretty decent.

2639	none	price	Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
1474	none	price	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
1553	none	price	Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).
2059	none	price	and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.

2717	none	price	I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.
1352	none	price	Hats off to the chef.
1543	none	price	This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.
3537	none	price	Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.
3213	none	price	Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.
1743	none	price	The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.

2907	none	price	service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.

3130	none	price	The food was bland oily.
3285	none	price	But they do.

1198	none	price	The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.
2380	none	price	Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).
2250	none	price	Suan has challenged this loyalty.
2302	none	price	Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.

973	none	price	Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy.
2132	none	price	The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.

1184	positive	price	It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.
250	none	price	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.

3686	none	price	Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
1922	none	price	Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.
2978	none	price	Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
2139	none	price	We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.

268	none	price	This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.
3613	none	price	(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).
1531	none	price	It could have been handled better.
603	none	price	The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.
678	none	price	The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.
2690	none	price	Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
1830	none	price	Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza!
1408	none	price	It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.
2521	none	price	The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.

1478	positive	price	Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.
1413	none	price	Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
3129	none	price	The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
2271	none	price	If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!

1557	none	price	(or sister, in my case!).

449	none	price	Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.
1449	none	price	Don't go there!
927	none	price	Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.
585	none	price	Good luck getting a table.

1085	none	price	Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.
2636	none	price	My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.
1179	none	price	I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.
1976	none	price	Finally!

3194	none	price	I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
688	negative	price	I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.

2201	positive	price	bottles of wine are cheap and good.
624	none	price	You will not be disapointed at all.
3252	none	price	Walk-ins are risky too.
620	none	price	The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
3541	none	price	They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.
865	none	price	You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
375	none	price	word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.
2126	positive	price	Very good service and very good prices.
2078	none	price	I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
846	none	price	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
2158	none	price	Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
1578	none	price	Our food was great too!
1282	none	price	Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
1319	none	price	The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.

763	none	price	We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
332	none	price	At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.

999	none	price	It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.

247	none	price	Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.

841	none	price	But, nothing stands out about the cooking.
3477	none	price	Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.
442	none	price	If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.
90	positive	price	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
298	none	price	I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.
1104	none	price	I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
2563	none	price	I work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.

3451	positive	price	overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.
1551	none	price	Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.
3146	none	price	Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.
1785	negative	price	It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
1492	none	price	Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.
406	none	price	It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.

2985	none	price	My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.
2084	none	price	The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).
2536	none	price	despite the untasteful previous review...
1820	none	price	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.

3193	none	price	The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.
93	none	price	My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.
2212	none	price	If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.
3426	none	price	I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.
1138	none	price	The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
1461	none	price	This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.
128	none	price	If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!

3471	none	price	I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.
3577	none	price	So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!
2283	none	price	However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.
614	none	price	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
3012	none	price	if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).

2386	none	price	The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.
3332	none	price	However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.
717	none	price	We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
680	none	price	It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
1345	none	price	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.
3013	none	price	We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!
1159	none	price	After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.

1209	negative	price	Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for.

3576	none	price	Our friends have not arrived yet.
3702	none	price	They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.
1911	none	price	I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.
703	none	price	The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!

1729	none	price	Pizza here is consistently good.
610	none	price	We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.
3211	none	price	After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.
2984	none	price	Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
1429	none	price	Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
1855	none	price	My husband and I enjoy Sangria.

3670	none	price	First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
685	none	price	Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!

3378	none	price	Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.
779	none	price	Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.

269	none	price	Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!
3169	negative	price	Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
3335	none	price	the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.
2356	none	price	And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
1199	none	price	The sauces used are also not that exciting.
2444	none	price	The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
720	none	price	I absolutely love this place!!!
340	none	price	The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
228	none	price	We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
651	none	price	The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
2664	none	price	I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
1930	none	price	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
2090	positive	price	I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
977	none	price	There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.
2433	none	price	There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.

2757	none	price	No thanks!!!

1659	none	price	I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
839	none	price	Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.
457	none	price	I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.

3086	positive	price	While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.

531	none	price	Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.

121	none	price	I pray it stays open forever.
3263	none	price	Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.
2939	positive	price	all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.
1678	negative	price	If you want to save some money, don't go here.
2606	none	price	My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
2019	none	price	I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).
1797	none	price	It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.
404	none	price	This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.
1731	none	price	You should pass on the calamari.

1425	none	price	But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.

3324	none	price	Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
1792	none	price	The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.
166	none	price	Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.
1679	none	price	I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.

3599	none	price	The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
502	none	price	We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.
981	none	price	Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
1987	none	price	On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.
2889	none	price	We will definitely go back.
1287	none	price	I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.

3626	none	price	If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.
1094	none	price	The food is amazing!!!!
2881	none	price	Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.
285	none	price	The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.

1493	none	price	The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!
1014	none	price	The atmosphere is great!!!
674	none	price	It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.
953	negative	price	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
405	none	price	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
3141	none	price	The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
466	none	price	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.

729	positive	price	The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
487	none	price	The pickles were great addition.
1434	none	price	If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.

1991	none	price	The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.

2726	none	price	Just go and see for yourself.
1680	none	price	The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
3605	none	price	Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
3624	none	price	I hate this.
1671	none	price	Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.

1700	none	price	Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
3589	none	price	get over it!
898	none	price	But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
2429	none	price	However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.
483	none	price	While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.

2795	negative	price	Priced at upper intermediate range.
342	none	price	The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
1239	none	price	I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.
767	negative	price	If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.
3157	none	price	Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.
2123	none	price	While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.
1861	none	price	So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.
2888	none	price	It's very spicy but not offensive.
2938	none	price	they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.
2544	none	price	I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.
408	none	price	The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
3703	none	price	They used shredded cheese on top!
129	none	price	They are located in the middle of Chinatown!

991	positive	price	For the location, the prices are very reasonable.
2284	neutral	price	The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
3531	none	price	My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
2654	none	price	I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.
1869	none	price	I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.
550	none	price	We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.

3676	none	price	The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.

1041	none	price	The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.

3060	none	price	Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.

2582	none	price	NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
2071	none	price	Try the sea bass.

2133	none	price	During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.
1054	none	price	But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.
1040	none	price	So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.
2278	none	price	The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
1324	none	price	A must for all the Dosa lovers.
1477	none	price	The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.

2916	negative	price	Over price, and small portions .
859	none	price	Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.

750	none	price	The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
2645	positive	price	BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.

2453	none	price	My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.
2193	none	price	But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.
1392	none	price	This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).

240	none	price	Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.
2030	none	price	Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
3000	none	price	Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.

2005	none	price	Everything about this restaurant was special.
3239	none	price	Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.

652	conflict	price	It is expensive but well worth the money.
2774	none	price	Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.

2183	none	price	I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.
2841	none	price	I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.
1418	none	price	I noted it was crossed off on the bill.

664	none	price	The staff is also attentive and friendly.
1644	positive	price	The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.
2036	negative	price	That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
1880	none	price	This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.
2101	negative	price	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
2113	none	price	first it took us a long time to find the place.
1822	positive	price	All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
2537	none	price	It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.
1594	none	price	The food was good too.
3459	none	price	We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.
3572	none	price	Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
845	none	price	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
3004	none	price	Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.
2441	none	price	I am a die hard peep lover.
965	none	price	Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.
1327	none	price	The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
1615	none	price	Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.
2681	none	price	The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.

1029	none	price	I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.
3470	none	price	And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.
3034	none	price	Don't waste your time, or money!!
3180	none	price	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
163	none	price	We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.
1017	none	price	sometimes i get good food and ok service.
3277	none	price	We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.
757	negative	price	It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.
923	none	price	This was a great surprise.
472	none	price	After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.
2223	none	price	The food was spicy and delicious.

3131	none	price	I just don't understand all the hype...
3649	none	price	Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.
1140	none	price	Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
2337	none	price	Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.
1174	none	price	Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.
3474	none	price	You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.
2818	none	price	This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
2920	none	price	I don't get it either.
162	none	price	Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
1216	none	price	Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
3530	none	price	It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
951	none	price	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
1005	none	price	One of my favorite places in Manhattan.
1619	none	price	They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.
1304	negative	price	We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
1856	none	price	We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.
3318	none	price	I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.

2545	none	price	I for one will never patronize them again.
1821	none	price	I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.
880	none	price	After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.
401	none	price	The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.
1238	none	price	So, again, give it a try.
889	none	price	Stay far away from this place.
21	none	price	We will come back!!!
2944	none	price	We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
3298	none	price	The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.

3536	positive	price	The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
1363	none	price	This food is asian-air fusion.
1065	positive	price	Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.
2137	none	price	The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.

200	none	price	Just an odd group.
1607	none	price	The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.

1886	none	price	The service was ok.
3512	none	price	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
538	none	price	I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!
3156	none	price	Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.

753	none	price	After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
2560	none	price	This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.

2601	none	price	You will find yourself returning quite often.

2027	none	price	A million better places to go in the city.

3253	none	price	Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.
2411	none	price	However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.
3139	none	price	Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.

2593	none	price	The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
3671	none	price	The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
3384	none	price	if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
103	none	price	Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
2076	conflict	price	try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.

1167	none	price	As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
3	none	price	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.

254	none	price	This restaurant was way overhyped.

1433	none	price	It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
2196	none	price	Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
1200	none	price	If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
2833	none	price	I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
3707	none	price	Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.

1552	none	price	I'd definitely recommend this little place.
3627	none	price	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
1867	none	price	The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.
2026	none	price	Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.
273	none	price	We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.

1597	positive	price	Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
910	none	price	Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.
1441	none	price	My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.

733	none	price	In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
3328	none	price	Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.
1305	none	price	In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
1951	none	price	Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.
1438	none	price	If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
2418	none	price	The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.
2555	positive	price	Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.
2688	conflict	price	The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.

1206	none	price	The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
2648	none	price	The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
1070	none	price	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!

289	none	price	I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.
1846	negative	price	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
958	none	price	I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
110	none	price	If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.

3544	none	price	The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
2304	none	price	They are FAST.
3688	none	price	It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
1182	positive	price	The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.
1303	negative	price	There are much better places in NY with better prices.
1064	none	price	Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
212	none	price	Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.
1313	negative	price	I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
1647	none	price	Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
1982	none	price	And I could do without the cigar smoke.
2902	none	price	Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
415	none	price	I've waited over one hour for food.
2822	none	price	Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.

1100	none	price	Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
1510	none	price	Great deal!

1786	positive	price	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.

1942	none	price	Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.
1894	none	price	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
153	none	price	This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
1346	none	price	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
3585	none	price	I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
204	none	price	Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
3216	none	price	The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
1686	negative	price	Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
2419	none	price	This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
713	none	price	Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
2581	none	price	We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
97	none	price	The wine list is also really nice.
161	none	price	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.

98	none	price	Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
2006	none	price	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
1721	none	price	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
690	negative	price	For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
3251	none	price	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
2272	negative	price	They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
601	none	price	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.

2162	none	price	Highly recommended to all!
2800	none	price	highly recommended.
2525	none	price	Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
1190	none	price	You have to increase the service a lot.
2336	none	price	Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.
3265	none	price	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
416	none	price	They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
3015	none	price	After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
364	none	price	After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
501	none	price	It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
1275	positive	price	Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.
2330	none	price	When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
460	none	price	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
1385	none	price	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
1088	none	price	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
3201	none	price	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
3481	none	price	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.
308	none	price	After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
1157	none	price	Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.
2394	none	price	Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.
2176	none	price	always fresh and delicious.
1129	none	price	The food was very good, but not very thai.
1872	none	price	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
1078	none	price	The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
61	none	price	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
1468	none	price	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
1268	none	price	The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
1900	none	price	Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
843	none	price	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
2184	none	price	Their sake martini is wonderful.
1151	none	price	Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
115	none	price	Bravissimo !!
2550	none	price	Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
3635	none	price	We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
2778	none	price	Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
903	none	price	When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
1227	none	price	Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
2130	none	price	This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
1824	none	price	It's to die for!
3076	none	price	Cute and decorative.
2269	none	price	I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
2577	none	price	fine dining restaurant quality.
2666	negative	price	Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.

1237	none	price	But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.
881	none	price	We were less than impressed.
417	none	price	A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
1309	none	price	but still my date was bad
1598	none	price	Would definitely go back again.
582	none	price	I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
864	none	price	The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
711	none	price	(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
2228	none	price	Sure, the setting is nice.
2493	none	price	Overall a worthwhile experience.
2879	conflict	price	The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
3432	neutral	price	Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
1212	none	price	It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
1582	none	price	THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
2287	none	price	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!

2773	negative	price	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
2155	none	price	Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
135	positive	price	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
2839	none	price	Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
3290	none	price	I had a great experience.
471	none	price	The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
2147	none	price	I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
480	none	price	The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.
37	none	price	The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
3160	none	price	Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.
3069	none	price	Go for it!
2072	none	price	Highly recommended.
1456	positive	price	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
3174	none	price	Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
3413	none	price	I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
1954	none	price	I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
643	none	price	To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
1271	none	price	The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
1631	positive	price	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
689	none	price	Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
3580	none	price	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
3524	none	price	We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
510	positive	price	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).

424	none	price	Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
3091	none	price	The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.
676	none	price	The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
7	none	price	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
1371	none	price	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
2091	negative	price	But $1 for each small piece???
1596	none	price	Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
1232	none	price	big and soft as well as good lunch food.
967	none	price	No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
1127	none	price	I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
2576	none	price	By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
2242	none	price	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
2650	none	price	Not a great place for family or general dining.
2529	none	price	As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
3167	none	price	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
1217	none	price	Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
1149	none	price	I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
2644	none	price	The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
2812	none	price	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
1028	none	price	What generous portions!
2167	none	price	The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
795	none	price	I was wrong.
573	none	price	The wine the service was very good too.
1082	none	price	So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
1080	none	price	The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
2929	none	price	No plans to return anytime soon.
752	none	price	I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
1641	none	price	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
3257	none	price	There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
2897	none	price	While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
872	none	price	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
2828	none	price	I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
2086	none	price	The meat dishes were only so-so.
3507	none	price	His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.
635	none	price	We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
957	none	price	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
2249	none	price	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
1724	none	price	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
761	none	price	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
1640	none	price	And you're hungry a few hours later.
2322	none	price	I can't wait to go back.
3476	none	price	I HATE HATE HATE this place.
2080	none	price	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
866	none	price	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
1031	none	price	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
712	none	price	The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.

305	none	price	The sushi is also great!
2843	none	price	From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.

2040	none	price	The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
3080	none	price	The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.
2849	none	price	All I can say is WOW!
1465	none	price	though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
2927	none	price	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.

698	none	price	The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
14	none	price	The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
557	none	price	The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
