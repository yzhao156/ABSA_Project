1553	negative	ambience	Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).
2059	none	ambience	and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.

1543	none	ambience	This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.

3213	none	ambience	Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.

250	positive	ambience	I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.

3566	none	ambience	This is where the aforementioned line was.
1702	none	ambience	The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
199	neutral	ambience	Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....

710	none	ambience	It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.
911	none	ambience	Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
3607	none	ambience	Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.
1955	conflict	ambience	Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.

680	neutral	ambience	It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.
1345	none	ambience	Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.

3702	none	ambience	They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.

3169	none	ambience	Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
3335	none	ambience	the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.
2356	none	ambience	And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
1199	none	ambience	The sauces used are also not that exciting.
2444	none	ambience	The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
720	none	ambience	I absolutely love this place!!!

228	none	ambience	We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!

2664	none	ambience	I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.
1930	none	ambience	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
2090	none	ambience	I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
977	none	ambience	There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.

2757	none	ambience	No thanks!!!

1659	none	ambience	I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.
839	conflict	ambience	Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.
457	none	ambience	I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
1306	none	ambience	my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.
3086	negative	ambience	While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.

121	none	ambience	I pray it stays open forever.
3263	none	ambience	Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.
2939	none	ambience	all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.
1678	none	ambience	If you want to save some money, don't go here.
2606	none	ambience	My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
2019	none	ambience	I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).

981	negative	ambience	Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.
1987	conflict	ambience	On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.
2889	none	ambience	We will definitely go back.
1287	none	ambience	I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.

1094	none	ambience	The food is amazing!!!!
2881	none	ambience	Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.
285	none	ambience	The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.

1014	positive	ambience	The atmosphere is great!!!
674	positive	ambience	It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.

405	none	ambience	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
3141	none	ambience	The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.
466	none	ambience	The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.

3327	none	ambience	The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.
1700	none	ambience	Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!

2071	none	ambience	Try the sea bass.

1040	negative	ambience	So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.
2278	none	ambience	The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
1324	none	ambience	A must for all the Dosa lovers.
1477	none	ambience	The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
3059	none	ambience	The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
2365	none	ambience	Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.

750	none	ambience	The food was well prepared and the service impecable.

2036	none	ambience	That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.
1880	none	ambience	This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.
2101	none	ambience	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.

845	positive	ambience	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
3004	none	ambience	Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.

923	none	ambience	This was a great surprise.

1174	conflict	ambience	Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.

1216	none	ambience	Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.
3530	none	ambience	It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).
951	none	ambience	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.

1619	none	ambience	They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.

3238	none	ambience	But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.
558	none	ambience	There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.

1099	none	ambience	Once for dinner and once for brunch.

200	none	ambience	Just an odd group.
1607	none	ambience	The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
2771	negative	ambience	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
1400	none	ambience	I love this place!

1173	none	ambience	At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.
1470	none	ambience	But the pizza is way to expensive.
2457	none	ambience	And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!
505	none	ambience	Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.

3512	none	ambience	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.

3371	none	ambience	Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
2115	none	ambience	but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
1546	none	ambience	Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.
753	none	ambience	After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
2560	none	ambience	This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.

2601	none	ambience	You will find yourself returning quite often.
3505	none	ambience	When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.
1747	none	ambience	Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!

1767	none	ambience	Fish is so very fresh.
634	none	ambience	The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.
3058	none	ambience	Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.

3140	none	ambience	The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.
1714	none	ambience	I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.
337	none	ambience	The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
2027	none	ambience	A million better places to go in the city.
595	none	ambience	If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.

2236	none	ambience	The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
274	none	ambience	Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.
2483	none	ambience	Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal.
1096	positive	ambience	This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
261	none	ambience	I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
2366	none	ambience	One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.

2431	none	ambience	The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.
2999	none	ambience	Great neighborhood joint.
741	none	ambience	The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.
775	none	ambience	The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).
800	none	ambience	My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food.
896	none	ambience	Ummm...the beer was cold.

2958	conflict	ambience	It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!
1618	none	ambience	We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
2254	positive	ambience	Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.
894	none	ambience	Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.
1800	none	ambience	We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
3253	none	ambience	Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.
2411	positive	ambience	However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.
3139	positive	ambience	Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.
2667	none	ambience	The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.
1002	positive	ambience	The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
1181	conflict	ambience	The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.
1052	none	ambience	Good bagels and good cream cheese.
2832	none	ambience	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.

1113	none	ambience	I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.
883	none	ambience	We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
834	negative	ambience	A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.
1968	none	ambience	I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner.
237	none	ambience	I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
1583	positive	ambience	I LOVED THE SHOWS.
2370	none	ambience	and i have been around the block, to say the very least.
2638	none	ambience	We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.

2886	none	ambience	My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.

1469	positive	ambience	The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
3565	none	ambience	As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.

1841	none	ambience	Give it a try and enjoy.
1691	none	ambience	Good food.
1545	none	ambience	...and that's saying a lot.
2117	none	ambience	those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
2593	none	ambience	The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
3671	none	ambience	The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.
3384	none	ambience	if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.
103	none	ambience	Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!
2076	none	ambience	try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.
3056	positive	ambience	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
2713	none	ambience	I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.
824	none	ambience	for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!
962	none	ambience	Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.
1666	none	ambience	Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
561	none	ambience	I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.
138	none	ambience	Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
1871	negative	ambience	I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.
2631	none	ambience	I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
1979	none	ambience	When you want a piece of beef, head on over.
2436	none	ambience	Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
1384	none	ambience	Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.
2669	none	ambience	I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.
3137	none	ambience	Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!
2662	none	ambience	Unbelievable.
1071	none	ambience	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
453	none	ambience	I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.
3698	none	ambience	The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
1167	none	ambience	As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.
3	none	ambience	The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.
1457	none	ambience	My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
254	none	ambience	This restaurant was way overhyped.
1530	none	ambience	I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.

1958	none	ambience	Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.

77	none	ambience	I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.
2087	none	ambience	Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you.
2617	none	ambience	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
1501	none	ambience	Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.
540	none	ambience	The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
3150	none	ambience	Food was okay, nothing great.

2238	none	ambience	I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
575	conflict	ambience	A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
1433	none	ambience	It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.
2196	none	ambience	Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.
1200	none	ambience	If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.
2833	positive	ambience	I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
3707	none	ambience	Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
3267	none	ambience	If you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, Kai may not be the best option.
3098	none	ambience	go here for the drinks!
2914	none	ambience	I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?
1552	none	ambience	I'd definitely recommend this little place.
3627	none	ambience	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.
1867	none	ambience	The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.
2026	none	ambience	Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.
273	none	ambience	We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
1489	none	ambience	Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.
1318	negative	ambience	It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.
660	none	ambience	I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!
2011	none	ambience	We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.
1563	none	ambience	Authentic Pakistani food.
3235	none	ambience	The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.
3480	none	ambience	Get it together.
1459	none	ambience	The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
1597	none	ambience	Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
910	none	ambience	Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.
1441	none	ambience	My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.
2016	none	ambience	We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
733	none	ambience	In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
3328	none	ambience	Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.
1305	none	ambience	In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.
1951	none	ambience	Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.
1438	none	ambience	If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.
2418	none	ambience	The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.
2555	none	ambience	Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.
2688	none	ambience	The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
2737	positive	ambience	The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
467	positive	ambience	A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.

1781	none	ambience	I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!
3606	none	ambience	The pizza was really good.
1454	none	ambience	The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.
3543	none	ambience	Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.
1206	negative	ambience	The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.
2648	none	ambience	The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
1070	negative	ambience	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!

2694	none	ambience	Kudos to Po!
621	positive	ambience	The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.

429	none	ambience	For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
589	neutral	ambience	It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.
289	none	ambience	I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.
1846	none	ambience	The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
958	none	ambience	I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
110	none	ambience	If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.

1612	none	ambience	Have the iced tea.
2826	none	ambience	For Park avenue I expected so much more.
3401	none	ambience	Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
35	none	ambience	So rude.
1226	none	ambience	you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!
3544	positive	ambience	The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
2304	none	ambience	They are FAST.
3688	conflict	ambience	It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
1182	none	ambience	The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.
1303	none	ambience	There are much better places in NY with better prices.
1064	positive	ambience	Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.
212	none	ambience	Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.
1313	none	ambience	I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.
1647	none	ambience	Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!
1982	negative	ambience	And I could do without the cigar smoke.
2902	none	ambience	Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
415	none	ambience	I've waited over one hour for food.
2822	none	ambience	Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
3268	positive	ambience	The ambience is very calm and quiet.
1100	none	ambience	Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
1510	none	ambience	Great deal!
2338	none	ambience	Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).
3345	none	ambience	not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.
1786	none	ambience	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
2754	none	ambience	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
1942	none	ambience	Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.
1894	positive	ambience	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
153	none	ambience	This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.
1346	none	ambience	Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.
3585	none	ambience	I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
204	conflict	ambience	Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
3216	none	ambience	The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
1686	none	ambience	Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
2419	none	ambience	This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).
713	none	ambience	Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.
2581	none	ambience	We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.
97	none	ambience	The wine list is also really nice.
161	none	ambience	I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.
1376	none	ambience	I plan on stopping by next week as well.

1067	none	ambience	Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
98	none	ambience	Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.
2006	none	ambience	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
1721	none	ambience	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
690	negative	ambience	For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
3251	none	ambience	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!
2272	none	ambience	They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.
601	positive	ambience	We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
615	none	ambience	The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.

2525	none	ambience	Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
1190	none	ambience	You have to increase the service a lot.
2336	negative	ambience	Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.
3265	none	ambience	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
416	none	ambience	They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
3015	none	ambience	After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
364	none	ambience	After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
501	none	ambience	It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.
1275	none	ambience	Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.
2330	none	ambience	When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
460	none	ambience	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
1385	positive	ambience	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
1088	none	ambience	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
3201	none	ambience	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
3481	negative	ambience	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.
308	none	ambience	After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.
1157	positive	ambience	Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.

2176	none	ambience	always fresh and delicious.
1129	none	ambience	The food was very good, but not very thai.
1872	none	ambience	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.
1078	none	ambience	The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.
61	positive	ambience	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
1468	none	ambience	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
1268	none	ambience	The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
1900	none	ambience	Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
843	positive	ambience	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.

1598	none	ambience	Would definitely go back again.
582	none	ambience	I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
864	none	ambience	The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
711	none	ambience	(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
2228	positive	ambience	Sure, the setting is nice.
2493	none	ambience	Overall a worthwhile experience.
2879	none	ambience	The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
3432	none	ambience	Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
1212	none	ambience	It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
1582	none	ambience	THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
2287	none	ambience	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
1160	positive	ambience	Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
2773	none	ambience	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
2155	none	ambience	Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
135	none	ambience	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
2839	none	ambience	Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
3290	none	ambience	I had a great experience.
471	none	ambience	The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
2147	none	ambience	I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
480	none	ambience	The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.
37	none	ambience	The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
3160	none	ambience	Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.
3069	none	ambience	Go for it!
2072	none	ambience	Highly recommended.
1456	none	ambience	You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
3174	none	ambience	Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
3413	none	ambience	I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
1954	positive	ambience	I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
643	none	ambience	To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
1271	none	ambience	The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
1631	none	ambience	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
689	none	ambience	Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
3580	none	ambience	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
3524	none	ambience	We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
510	none	ambience	Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
600	none	ambience	It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
424	none	ambience	Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
3091	negative	ambience	The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.
676	none	ambience	The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
7	none	ambience	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
1371	none	ambience	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
2091	none	ambience	But $1 for each small piece???
1596	none	ambience	Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
1232	none	ambience	big and soft as well as good lunch food.
967	none	ambience	No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
1127	none	ambience	I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
2576	none	ambience	By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
2242	none	ambience	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
2650	none	ambience	Not a great place for family or general dining.
2529	none	ambience	As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
3167	none	ambience	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
1217	none	ambience	Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
1149	none	ambience	I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
2644	none	ambience	The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
2812	none	ambience	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
1028	none	ambience	What generous portions!
2167	none	ambience	The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
795	none	ambience	I was wrong.
573	none	ambience	The wine the service was very good too.
1082	positive	ambience	So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
1080	none	ambience	The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
2929	none	ambience	No plans to return anytime soon.
752	none	ambience	I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
1641	none	ambience	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
3257	positive	ambience	There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
2897	positive	ambience	While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
872	positive	ambience	I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
2828	none	ambience	I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
2086	none	ambience	The meat dishes were only so-so.
3507	positive	ambience	His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.
635	none	ambience	We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
957	none	ambience	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
2249	none	ambience	I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
1724	positive	ambience	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
761	none	ambience	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
1640	none	ambience	And you're hungry a few hours later.
2322	none	ambience	I can't wait to go back.
3476	none	ambience	I HATE HATE HATE this place.
2080	none	ambience	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
866	none	ambience	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
1031	positive	ambience	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
712	none	ambience	The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
3226	none	ambience	Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.
3093	none	ambience	Wonderful!
931	none	ambience	It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
979	none	ambience	The service is descent even when this small place is packed.

1414	none	ambience	Go hungry and enjoy.
3603	none	ambience	I have eaten a lot of pizza here.
2809	none	ambience	This place is worth an one-hour drive.
2567	none	ambience	Great value for the quality ingredients.
1419	none	ambience	The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
305	none	ambience	The sushi is also great!
2843	none	ambience	From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
1931	none	ambience	Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
181	none	ambience	The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
3579	none	ambience	I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
2455	none	ambience	The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
2040	none	ambience	The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
3080	none	ambience	The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.
2849	none	ambience	All I can say is WOW!
1465	conflict	ambience	though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
2927	positive	ambience	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
1544	positive	ambience	This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
2161	none	ambience	The lox is always fresh too.
3115	none	ambience	Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.
1341	none	ambience	Service was very friendly.
3468	none	ambience	So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.
840	none	ambience	Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
1011	none	ambience	We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
698	none	ambience	The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
14	none	ambience	The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
557	none	ambience	The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
1788	none	ambience	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
3302	none	ambience	The staff offers impeccable service.
1651	none	ambience	The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
160	none	ambience	We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
1777	none	ambience	wont come back again for sure!
919	none	ambience	i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
2427	none	ambience	This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
2404	positive	ambience	The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
116	none	ambience	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
2008	none	ambience	The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
2206	none	ambience	After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
1010	none	ambience	And the bill was outragous.
89	none	ambience	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
2994	none	ambience	Kind, attentive wait staff.
879	none	ambience	Bon appettite!!
2572	none	ambience	Salads were fantastic.
1288	none	ambience	The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
3604	none	ambience	La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
1723	none	ambience	The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
3491	none	ambience	The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
3610	none	ambience	A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
2909	none	ambience	skip dessert.
2656	none	ambience	We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
2598	none	ambience	It is simply amazing.

1795	none	ambience	It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.
2992	none	ambience	I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.
3438	positive	ambience	The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
1276	none	ambience	A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
730	none	ambience	It's all about the food !!
1870	none	ambience	Fast service.
2367	none	ambience	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
1519	none	ambience	The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic.
2904	none	ambience	stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
1009	none	ambience	The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
2642	none	ambience	We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
43	neutral	ambience	ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).
1460	conflict	ambience	The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
307	none	ambience	This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
860	none	ambience	Bravo, Blue Hill!
2594	none	ambience	Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.

2665	none	ambience	This place is to be avoided.
2095	none	ambience	Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.
989	positive	ambience	The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.
1803	none	ambience	My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
3047	none	ambience	We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
850	none	ambience	At 6:30, we were the third party there.
2993	positive	ambience	delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
2596	none	ambience	I will definetly be going back.
3602	none	ambience	No, really.
3108	none	ambience	The food is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.
3439	none	ambience	The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
1604	none	ambience	I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
1440	none	ambience	The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
101	positive	ambience	i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
351	none	ambience	Try sushimi cucumber roll.
2009	none	ambience	I'm saving up for my next visit.
988	none	ambience	The food is delicious.
2963	none	ambience	Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.
3412	positive	ambience	This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
1311	none	ambience	Amma is nothing special.
246	none	ambience	Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
1771	none	ambience	believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
1913	none	ambience	Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
1394	positive	ambience	The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
226	none	ambience	I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
3642	none	ambience	The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
2159	none	ambience	The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
1708	none	ambience	I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.

230	none	ambience	Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!

15	none	ambience	My friends and I showed up on a Sat.

2465	positive	ambience	PERFECT FOR DATES!
2038	none	ambience	The food was boring and expensive.

130	none	ambience	The service is ok but could be better.
702	positive	ambience	We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!

3030	none	ambience	(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.
1320	none	ambience	Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
328	none	ambience	Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
512	none	ambience	Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.

3063	none	ambience	Finally!
1977	conflict	ambience	Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?
87	none	ambience	Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
2499	none	ambience	I've never been disappointed.
2093	none	ambience	I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
2153	none	ambience	We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).
721	none	ambience	From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
1156	positive	ambience	Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
2409	none	ambience	And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.

1517	none	ambience	For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
611	none	ambience	Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
2379	none	ambience	But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.

2305	none	ambience	I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
2989	none	ambience	We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
848	none	ambience	Beautiful experience.
2156	none	ambience	The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.
1966	none	ambience	If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
2088	negative	ambience	Decor leaves something to be desired.
1150	none	ambience	Jimmy is Dominican!
185	none	ambience	Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
1710	positive	ambience	Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
2610	none	ambience	Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
649	none	ambience	When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
3450	none	ambience	in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
974	none	ambience	I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.
3089	positive	ambience	Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
647	none	ambience	The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.
2954	none	ambience	The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
378	none	ambience	My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
490	none	ambience	If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
3245	none	ambience	Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
1426	none	ambience	This is also where I was from.
1992	none	ambience	Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
