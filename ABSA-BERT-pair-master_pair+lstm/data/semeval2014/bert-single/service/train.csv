2196	none	service	Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.

3627	none	service	Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.

3585	none	service	I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
204	none	service	Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
3216	none	service	The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.
1686	none	service	Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
2419	none	service	This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).

690	none	service	For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
3251	negative	service	Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!

1190	negative	service	You have to increase the service a lot.
2336	none	service	Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.
3265	none	service	I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
416	negative	service	They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.

460	none	service	I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.
1385	positive	service	Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.
1088	none	service	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
3201	positive	service	The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
3481	none	service	If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.

2176	none	service	always fresh and delicious.
1129	none	service	The food was very good, but not very thai.
1872	positive	service	Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.

61	none	service	This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
1468	none	service	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
1268	none	service	The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.

2228	none	service	Sure, the setting is nice.
2493	none	service	Overall a worthwhile experience.
2879	positive	service	The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.

1212	none	service	It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.

1954	none	service	I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
643	none	service	To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
1271	none	service	The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
1631	none	service	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
689	none	service	Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
3580	none	service	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.

7	negative	service	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!

2091	none	service	But $1 for each small piece???
1596	none	service	Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.

2529	none	service	As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
3167	none	service	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
1217	none	service	Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.

2644	none	service	The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
2812	none	service	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
1028	none	service	What generous portions!
2167	none	service	The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
795	none	service	I was wrong.
573	positive	service	The wine the service was very good too.
1082	none	service	So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
1080	none	service	The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
2929	none	service	No plans to return anytime soon.
752	none	service	I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
1641	none	service	Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
3257	none	service	There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
2897	none	service	While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.

1724	none	service	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
761	none	service	For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
1640	none	service	And you're hungry a few hours later.
2322	none	service	I can't wait to go back.
3476	none	service	I HATE HATE HATE this place.
2080	positive	service	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
866	positive	service	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
1031	negative	service	You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
